Backstory:
Kaelos Solarius was once a noble knight in the service of the Celestial Dominion, a kingdom blessed by divine power and prosperity. As a young soldier, Kaelos was renowned for his bravery and sense of honor. He was the model of what every knight should aspire to be: strong, resolute, and loyal to his king and his people. However, in one fateful night, everything Kaelos knew was shattered.

The kingdom fell to a treacherous coup. The ruling family, which had long protected the land with wisdom and justice, was overthrown by a group of dark sorcerers and corrupt nobles. Kaelos, leading a small band of warriors, fought valiantly to protect the royal family. But the betrayal came from within — a trusted general, whom Kaelos had called a brother, was among the conspirators. In the chaos, Kaelos witnessed the brutal assassination of the king and his family, and his once-proud kingdom fell into the hands of dark forces.

In the aftermath, Kaelos found himself alone, surrounded by the ruin of his nation. His heart burned with rage, but more than that — it burned with a need for justice. He swore an oath that night, beneath the blood-red sky: he would not rest until he avenged the destruction of his kingdom. Those who had betrayed his people would feel the full force of his fury.

Kaelos took up the Oath of Vengeance, abandoning his former oaths of service and duty. His sole purpose was clear — to hunt down those responsible for the massacre of his king and his people. He would not hesitate, would not falter. He would become the embodiment of righteous fury, bringing swift retribution to those who had broken their vows and shattered his world.

He searched for months, years even, through cities, forests, and forgotten ruins, tracking down the culprits one by one. His once shining armor now bore the marks of countless battles, but his resolve never wavered. With each dark sorcerer he destroyed, with each traitor he brought to justice, his soul grew heavier, the weight of vengeance turning his once pure heart into a cold instrument of divine retribution.

His powers, too, began to change. No longer were his strikes guided by the light of mercy or honor. Instead, they were sharpened by his burning desire for vengeance. When he marked a target, his sword would strike without hesitation, the divine energy of his oath empowering him to hunt down his foes no matter how far they fled. Each victory fueled his wrath further, but also brought him closer to the truth: that vengeance, once sweet, was never enough to restore what was lost.

Still, Kaelos does not rest. His vengeance is not a personal vendetta alone; it is a divine mission. He knows that until every traitor is slain, every shadowy figure that worked against his king is brought to justice, the world will remain unbalanced. In his quest, he has become an unstoppable force, a harbinger of divine wrath. And though the path he treads is one of endless pursuit, Kaelos is driven by the thought that perhaps, one day, his vengeance will be complete.

But deep within his heart, he knows that vengeance has its price — and with each act of retribution, a piece of his soul may be lost forever. He will never stop until his enemies are destroyed, but he wonders: once justice is served, what will be left of him?
